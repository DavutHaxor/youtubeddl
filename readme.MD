# youtubeddl

youtubeddl is a yt-dlp gui for Linux written in Electron.js

youtubeddl uses child process module to execute shell commands and save the video automatically without passing any arguments to yt-dlp.


## Required dependencies:
Electron
Python 
Yt-dlp
Grep
Cat

Almost all of these are found in Linux machines so you will probably only install yt-dlp as a package from your package manager or from pip, if your distribution allows it.

I wont bother creating one for windows since it sucks.
